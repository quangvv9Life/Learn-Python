# Suppose you want to build a phone book like this. 
# You’re mapping people’s names to phone numbers. Your phone book needs to have this functionality:

# Add a person’s name and the phone number associated with that person.
# Enter a person’s name, and get the phone number associated with that name.

# make a new hash table
phone_book = {}

# add the phone numbers of some people into this phone book

phone_book["PT"] = 84916131633
phone_book["Q"] = 84946279266

print(phone_book["Q"])
